This project involves implementing a Web application that display grocery store scores that are generated from multiple ranking parameters. It is important to note tha the scorecard (at least at this point in time) will focus on local grocery stores and earned points will be based on affirmative conditions (i.e., verifiable products or services) rather than absence of such conditions.
