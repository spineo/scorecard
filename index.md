This project implements a Web application that displays grocery store scores that are generated from multiple ranking parameters. The scorecard (at least at this point) will focus on local grocery stores and earned points will be based on affirmative conditions (i.e., verifiable products or services) rather than the absence of such conditions.

## User Interaction

The home page displays the grocery stores in order of ranking (i.e., highest to lowest) with grocery store names linking to a detail page with the ranking factors.

## Ranking Update

An update form, accessible by approved users, will be used to submit a new ranking or update an existing one.

## Admin Interface

The Admin interface will manage user accounts.

## Example Ranking Factors (integrate as shareable and/or editable document)
